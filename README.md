# JsPrintnutsUi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.3.

# Overview

This repository contains the Angular based frontend application for the Printnuts 3D printing website. It is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.
This application communicates with the backend services via RESTful APIs, and uses the js.printnuts.module for shared resources and utilities. It follows a modular architecture, with components, services, and utilities organized in a structured manner for easy navigation and scalability.

# Installation

To set up this application in your local environment, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Rares212/js.printnuts.ui.git
    Navigate to the repository: cd js.printnuts.ui
    Install the dependencies: npm/yarn install

# Usage

To run the application locally, use the command: yarn run dev

This will start a development server, and the application will be accessible at http://localhost:4200 (or the port specified in your environment variables).

For production builds, use the command: npm run build

This will create a build directory with the production-ready files.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
